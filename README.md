# VR

1 Software and Hardware Requirements

• Unity 2018.3.x
• Programming language C#
• Oculus Rift + Touch
• If no HMD is available to you, use the VRTK Plugin’s VR Simulator


2 Application Requirements
1. User can move objects (i.e. change location & rotation) using the Virtual Hand technique.
2. User can move freely inside the environment using the Jumping technique.
3. User can receive information about the possible interactions supported by an object.
4. User can duplicate or delete objects.
5. User can change the scale of objects.
6. User can interact with at least one virtual device in the room

e.g., the ray, virtual hand or text are clearly visible, not too bright, too dark, too thin, ...
10. The average framerate is above 80 Hz at any point in the environment.
